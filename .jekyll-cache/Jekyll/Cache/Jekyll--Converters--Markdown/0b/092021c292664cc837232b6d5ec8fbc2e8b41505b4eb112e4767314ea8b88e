<p>Getting this up and running was a lot of fun. Deploying a themed Jekyll page used to be automatic through github itself, but the functionality was removed due to security issues a few weeks ago or something. Figuring out how to get this page up and running in a way that allowed me to actually modify it took much longer than it should have. The problem:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  /opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.0.4/x64/bin/bundle install --jobs 4
  Your bundle only supports platforms ["x64-mingw-ucrt"] but your local platform
  is x86_64-linux. Add the current platform to the lockfile with
  `bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux` and try again.
  Took   1.62 seconds
Error: Error: The process '/opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.0.4/x64/bin/bundle' failed with exit code 16
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why? Who knows why. T</p>
