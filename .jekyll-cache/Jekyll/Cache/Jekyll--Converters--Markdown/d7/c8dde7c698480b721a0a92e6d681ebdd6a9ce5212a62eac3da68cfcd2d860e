<p>Iâ€™ve been meaning to make this post for weeks now, and itâ€™s been so long that I donâ€™t even remember which documentation I was supposed to write about reading. Probably Jekyll, since I had so much trouble getting it up and running. The documentation on the github was completely wrong, likely due to the recent changes to the ability to launch a Jekyll theme from the github site itself. The other five pages</p>
