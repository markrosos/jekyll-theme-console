I"≠<h1 id="read-the-documentation">Read the documentation</h1>

<p>I‚Äôve been meaning to make this post for weeks now, and it‚Äôs been so long that I don‚Äôt even remember which documentation I was supposed to write about reading. Probably Jekyll, since I had so much trouble getting it up and running. The documentation on the github was completely wrong, likely due to the recent changes to the ability to launch a Jekyll theme from the github site itself. The other five random ‚Äúhelp‚Äù blogs I read didn‚Äôt help much either. It was only the documentation on the Jekyll site itself that allowed me to get this up and running in a way that allowed me to modify it as I see fit.</p>
