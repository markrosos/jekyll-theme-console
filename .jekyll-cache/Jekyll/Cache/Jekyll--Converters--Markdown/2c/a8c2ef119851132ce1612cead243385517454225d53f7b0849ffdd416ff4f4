<p>Getting this up and running was a lot of fun. Deploying a themed Jekyll page used to be automatic through github itself, but the functionality was removed due to security issues a few weeks ago or something. Figuring out how to get this page up and running in a way that allowed me to actually modify it took much longer than it should have.</p>
